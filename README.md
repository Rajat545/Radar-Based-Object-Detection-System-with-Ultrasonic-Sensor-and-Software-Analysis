# Radar-Based-Object-Detection-System-with-Ultrasonic-Sensor-and-Software-Analysis
Developed a radar-based object detection system using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) and Arduino integrated with ESP32. Implemented software analysis for real-time object detection and display using a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Components Required
- **Arduino** (Uno or similar)
- **ESP32** development board
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**
- **Breadboard** and **connecting wires**
- **Laptop or PC** with Arduino IDE
- Software environment for GUI display (e.g., **Processing**, **Python with Tkinter**, or a **web-based framework**)

## Hardware Setup

### Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) Connection:
1. Connect the **VCC** pin of the HC-SR04 to the **5V** pin on the Arduino.
2. Connect the **GND** pin of the HC-SR04 to the **GND** pin on the Arduino.
3. Connect the **Trigger** pin to a digital pin (e.g., **D9**) on the Arduino.
4. Connect the **Echo** pin to another digital pin (e.g., **D10**) on the Arduino.

### Arduino to ESP32 Connection:
1. Connect the **TX** pin of the Arduino to the **RX** pin of the ESP32 (and vice versa if needed).
2. Use a **voltage divider** if required, as ESP32 typically uses **3.3V logic**, while Arduino uses **5V**.

### Power and Ground:
- Ensure all devices share a common **ground (GND)**.

### Power Supply:
- Use a reliable **USB power source** for the Arduino and ESP32.

## Software Setup

### Arduino IDE:
1. Install necessary libraries, such as **NewPing** for controlling the HC-SR04.
2. Write code to control the ultrasonic sensor, calculate object distances, and send data to the ESP32.

### ESP32 Setup:
1. Install the **ESP32 board package** in Arduino IDE.
2. Program the ESP32 to receive data from the Arduino and relay it to the chosen software interface.

### GUI Development:
1. Select a GUI development platform (e.g., **Processing** for a Java-based GUI, or **Python with Tkinter**).
2. Write code to receive data from the ESP32, analyze it, and visually display object distances on a radar-like interface.
